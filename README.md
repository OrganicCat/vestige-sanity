# Vestige of Sanity

## Introduction

Vestige of Sanity is a mod based around blood and magic. It's meant to introduce new uses for those hundreds of cows, and other creatures you've penned up. There's a cost for this magic, however. A balance to the power. Power attracts power, and this means things that go bump in the night will come for you.

I'd like to eventually include a sanity mechanic as well.

## Setup

1. Edit build.gradle and mod.json to suit your needs.
    * The "mixins" object can be removed from mod.json if you do not need to use mixins.
    * Please replace all occurences of "modid" with your own mod ID - sometimes, a different string may also suffice.
2. Run the following command:

```
./gradlew idea
```
